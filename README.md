# LaundryTwo
## About
After about a month at college, I got fed up with the LaundryView app I was using. I would continue to get notifications even once the machine had ended, not see when a machine was in "Idle" mode, and a few other things. So I made LaundryTwo with a modern, easy-to-use interface, while still maintaining all the necessary features (and adding some!).
## Help
From the Locations page, you can search for your school/apartment building. Once there, find the laundry room your would like to view. There may only be one for some properties. There you will be able to see each washer and dryer, set an alarm for specific machines, and mark the room as a favorite using the star in the top left.
